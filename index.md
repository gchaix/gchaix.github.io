I am a system administrator, developer, and project manager qualiﬁed by twenty years experience in deploying and adapting open source technology to customer needs. With broad-based experience in rapid deployment of systems to governmental, educational, and nonproﬁt organizations, I love designing and building systems that fulfill their needs.

I get a thrill out of making servers go big and go fast!
